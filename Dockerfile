# --- Stage 1: build the Go backend (the slow part) -------------------------
# Compiling the Go dependencies takes far longer than the frontend, so this
# stage does it first. It only depends on the Go sources, which lets BuildKit
# run it in parallel with the frontend stage. The expensive dependency
# compilation is warmed against a placeholder embed directory here; the final
# stage then re-links in seconds once the real frontend is available.

RUN go mod download

COPY backend/ ./

# Warm the Go build cache by compiling against a placeholder embed dir (the
# `//go:embed all:dist` directive requires it to exist). This pre-compiles all
# dependencies so the final build only has to recompile main and embed the
# frontend. Flags must match the final build (notably -trimpath, which is part
# of the build cache key) so the compiled packages are actually reused.
